    <h2>2. Methods</h2>
    <p>The prosthetic procedure, laboratory stages, and used materials were the same for all three clinical cases described below. The preparation technique we used in all cases followed the BOPT protocol described by Loi in 2013. This technique involves the use of a diamond flame-shaped bur (6863D.314.016, Komet, Italy) for the abutment tooth preparation mounted in a high-speed handpiece. Before starting the dental preparation, the gingival sulcus was sounded with a calibrated probe (Hawe Click-ProbeÂ®, KerrHawe SA, Switzerland) to establish the preparation depth. The tooth was prepared until the bottom of the probed sulcus. A vertical area without a finish line was created, and the interim restoration was relined using a self-curing methacrylate resin (Sintodent, Italy). The new emergence profile was positioned in the gingival sulcus without violating the biologic width.</p>

    <p>The movement of the crown axis of the abutment teeth was achieved by means of the BOPT with the POA in all cases where tooth movement was required. The tooth movement was obtained by preparing the abutment teeth with the feather-edge preparation (BOPT) more on the one side than the opposite. For example, if mesial movement of the abutment tooth was required, the tooth was prepared more on the distal side so that the abutment tooth could be moved mesially. In this way, the crown could be moved in the desired direction while simultaneously maintaining the tooth proportion, simulating an orthodontic treatment. In the preparation without a finish line (vertical preparation), the crown is positioned in a vertical area of the abutment tooth so that when the vertical area is moved in a given direction, the crown can be moved together with the abutment tooth and the same tooth proportion can be maintained. Contrarily, in the horizontal finish line preparation, the crown margin is continuous with the external root profile, so that even if the distal side is prepared more than the mesial side, the crown axis cannot be moved without altering the tooth proportion. During the interim stage, the crown margins of the interim crown restorations were shortened if signs of inflammations (redness, bleeding) were detected, and the final impressions were taken only when the soft tissue appeared healthy and free from inflammation at every point.</p>
