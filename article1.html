    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In this study, three cases involving patients who required multidisciplinary treatment for the aesthetic and functional rehabilitation of the maxillary or mandibular arch are described. In particular, an indication for preprosthetic orthodontic treatment, such as orthodontic extrusion, tooth realignment, correction of malocclusion, and diastemata closure, was present in all cases. Preprosthetic orthodontic treatment to resolve these issues before the restorative procedures was proposed; however, all patients refused preprosthetic orthodontic treatment. Thus, to restore aesthetics and function, solely a feather-edge prosthetic protocol has been used. The biologically oriented preparation technique was used to prepare the teeth that were moved in the established direction by preparing the abutment more on one side than the opposite. This so called “prosthetic orthodontic approach” allowed resolving clinical issues that would typically require preprosthetic orthodontic treatment, such as complete clinical crown loss, occlusal vertical dimension loss, tooth misalignment, malocclusion, tooth agenesis, and severe multiple diastemata. The degree of reciprocal movement of the prepared teeth achievable through this approach was minor and not comparable to a traditional wide-range orthodontic movement. Besides, the technique resulted in a modification of the gingival tissues and improvement of their thickness although it is unclear what effect this technique has on the gingival biotype. None of the patients had prosthetic or periodontal complications for at least 12 months following the procedure. Gingival health was excellent, and the prosthetic procedure did not affect the pulp survival of the vital teeth. The biologically oriented preparation technique used with a prosthetic orthodontic approach can effectively manage complicated cases without the need for preprosthetic orthodontics.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The biologically oriented preparation technique (BOPT) is a prosthetic protocol which consists of a feather-edge subgingival preparation whereby the gingival profile adapts itself to the new prosthetic coronal emergence profile. This is made possible by the elimination of an emergence profile of the tooth or any preexisting finish line. A new prosthetic emergence profile is created by placing the prosthesis in such a way that leaves the gingival margin at the desired position.</p>
    
    <p>The BOPT protocol has been shown to increase gingival thickness and achieve stable and healthy soft and hard tissues in natural teeth. The same protocol has been described for dental implants showing good clinical outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>An example of soft tissue adaptation to the new prosthetic emergence profile after the BOPT protocol is shown in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1, the central incisor (Figure 1(a)) was prepared with a feather-edge preparation using a flame-shaped bur on the bottom of the previously probed sulcus and eliminating the preexisting finishing line. A new emergence profile was created with the interim restoration that was positioned 1.5 mm coronally to the gingival margin (Figure 1(b)). After one month of soft tissue maturation, the gingiva adapted itself to the new emergence profile (Figure 1(c)). In Figure 2, the canine (Figure 2(a)) was prepared with the same technique and the interim crown restoration was left 0.5 mm subgingivally for one month (Figure 1(b)). After this period, the interim crown restoration was shortened (Figure 1(c)), and one month later, the gingiva adapted itself to the new emergence profile (Figure 1(d)). In this series of clinical cases, the teeth were moved by means of the feather-edge preparation, avoiding a preprosthetic orthodontic treatment, and the BOPT protocol was then used to guide the soft tissue maturation to the new tooth position. This tooth movement solely by means of the dental preparation was termed the “prosthetic orthodontic approach (POA).” The approach allowed only small tooth movements and is not suitable to perform complex orthodontic movements with a large range of action. In the clinical cases described, we presented all thick gingival biotypes with the exception of the lower incisors in case number two where we also made a diagnosis of severe gingival recession. The procedural technique followed would seem to result in a thickening of the gingiva. The phenotype after therapy appeared pink and healthy, although it is unclear what effect this technique has on the gingival biotype itself. Further studies, both clinical and histologic, are needed to elucidate what the biological mechanisms are for gingival tissue to be modified.</p>
